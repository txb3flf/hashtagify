# Interview

## Goals

To evalute the ability to read and improve existing code.

## Prompt

You have an existing implemention of a program which converts inputs to hashtags.

It has passing unit tests.

You are to look at the tests and for each test:

- Say what code in the application is tested by the test
- Make any improvements to that particular code block **optimizing for readability**

## Requirements of the Hashtag Program

The return value should:

- start with an octothorpe (#)

- have the first letter of each word capitalized

- be false if the final result is longer than 140 chars

- be false if the input or the result is an empty string
